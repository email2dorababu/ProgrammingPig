Pig provides an engine for executing data flows in parallel on Hadoop.
These data flows are expressed in a language called - pig Latin.
Pig is an Apache open source project: This means users are 
free to download it as source or binary, 
use it for themselves, 
contribute to it, and—
under the terms of the Apache License: 
—use it in their products and change it as they see fit.

Pig On Hadoop:
Pig runs on Hadoop, means it makes use of both HDFS and MR.
HDFS:
it reads data from HDFS, stores intermediate data in HDFS and writes final results on HDFS.
It can also read input from and write output to sources other than HDFS.
MR:
In the map phase, the application has the opportunity to operate on each record in the input sepaately.
Many Maps are started at once so ,let input can be GBs or TBs, given enough machines, the map phase can usually be completed in under one minute.
Every record for a given key will go to the same reducer.
