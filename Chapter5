Introduction To PIG LATIN:
Advanced features are covered in Chapter 6.
----------------------------
Basics: 
Pig latin is data flow language.
Each processing step results in new data set, or relation.
eg. input = load 'data' -  input is name of the relation resulting from loading of data set 'data'.
Relation name is called ALIAS.
Relation names are not variables. Once made, assignment is permanent. But you can reuse the names.

A = load 'NYSE_dividends' (exchange, symbol, date, dividends);

Field Names - dividends,symbol.
A - relation name(alias).

The fields contain different value for each record , but you cannot assign values to them.
Relation and filed names should start with alphabetic character. can contain alphanumeric and _(underscore).

Case Sensitivity:
-------------------
UDF,Relation, field names are case sensitive. e.g COUNT is not the same as count UDF.
Keyworkds are not case sensive . e.g LOAD is equivalent to load.

Comments -SQL style --,/* */
