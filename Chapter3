GRUNT - PG 19
--------------------

GRUNT is pig's interactive shell. With grunt we can enter pig latin interactively and we can interact with HDFS.

to enter GRUNT - type
pig -x local  this results into grunt prompt.

grunt>  here with this grunt shell, you can interact with local file system.
If you omit -x local, and you  have a cluster configuration set in PIG_CLASSPATH, then you can interact with HDFS on ur cluster.

Grunt provides - command line history and editing and also TAB completion(for commands only).
Grunt is a useful shell, but not full fledged like standard unix shells. Pipes, redirection and background execution are not present in Grunt.
To exit, type- exit or ctrl-D
----------------
You can enter the commands interactively in the shel. and Pig will not start executing PIG latin until it sees either STORE or DUMP.
however it will do basic syntax and semantic checking to help you catch errors quickly.
incase you enter a line with errors,You can reenter the line using the same alias, pig will take the last instance of the line you enter.
----------------------
HDFS commands in GRUNT
grunt acts as a shell for HDFS. in 0.5 or later pig, haoop fs shell commands are available. 
They are accessed using the keyword FS. and use a dash[-] 
e.g grunt> fs -ls
see list of all hdfs shell commands
http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/r0.20.2/hdfs_shell.html
and basic unix commands are also supported.

cat filename - print contenst to stdout, you can apply this command to DIRECTORY 
copyFromLocal localfile hdfsfile - copy a file from your local disk to HDFS. this is done serially, not in parallel.
copyToLocal hdfsfile localfile  - cpies HDFS file to local disk, serially, not in parallel.
rmr filename - remove files recursively. equivivalant to rm -r in Unix. use with atmost caution.
-----------------------------------------
PG 21 :
controlling PIG from GRUNT: Grunt provides commands for controlling PIG and MR.

kill jobid - kill mr job associated with jobid. find job id from hadoop JT GUI.
you can terminate pig process by ctrl-c or kill, not kill -9. this kill -9 does not give pig the change to cleanup temp files
it is using, which can leave a garbage in your cluster.

Exec [-param param_name=param_value] [-param_file filename] script
  Executes pig latin script. Aliases defined in script are not imported into grunt.
  this command is useful for testing your pig latin scripts inside a grunt session.
Run [-param param_name=param_value] [-param_file filename] script
  executes pig latin script in the CURRENT grunt shell. the aliases referenced in script are available to grunt,
  the commands in script are accessible via the shell history. this is another option for testing pig latin scripts inside grunt session.
