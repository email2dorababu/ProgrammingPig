Pig does not need to be installed in hadoop cluster.
It runs on the machine from which you launch jadoop jobs.i.e pig is installed on one or more machines that have access to the 
hadoop cluster but are not part of the cluster.(i.e not DN or TT nodes). 
THis machines are called gateway machines or edge machines.
COre of pig is writen in Java, hence it is portable across OSes.
The Shell script that starts Pig is a bash Script, so it requires Unix env.
Set JAVA_HOME.
